\begin{abstract}
Toxic gas detection in industrial contexts is a key safety problem, necessitating the strategic positioning of sensors for efficient monitoring. However, the ideal placement of these sensors is a difficult optimisation problem due to factors such as gas dispersion patterns, facility layout, and economic considerations. Traditional methodologies frequently fail to provide efficient solutions, resulting in suboptimal sensor combinations and possible safety risks. This study presents an innovative solution to this problem using the Sailfish Optimizer algorithm within the context of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The Sailfish Optimizer Algorithm (SOA), inspired by sailfish cooperative hunting behaviour, provides a novel solution to optimisation issues that involve exploring and exploiting search space. The programme quickly navigates across solution spaces by simulating the coordinated movement of sailfish, seeking optimal configurations that minimise the risk caused by poisonous gases while maximising coverage and lowering expenses. By comparing the performance of the Sailfish Optimizer algorithm to standard optimisation techniques, we demonstrate its superiority in achieving optimal sensor combinations. Furthermore, we assess the algorithm's capacity to solve real issues including scalability, adaptability, and integration with current IIoT infrastructure.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

In industrial environments, ensuring the safety and well-being of workers is paramount, particularly in the context of toxic gas detection. The presence of toxic gases can result in substantial health concerns for personnel, contribute to contamination of the environment, and create costly disruptions to operations if they are not discovered or managed\cite{cui2023toxic}. In light of this, the strategic positioning of gas detection sensors is an extremely important factor in the protection of industrial facilities and the provision of uninterrupted operations. For the first time ever, capabilities for real-time monitoring and proactive risk management have been made possible thanks to the IIoT, which has enabled the integration of modern sensor technologies and data analytics\cite{jena2023lpg}.

In industrial settings that are enabled by the IIoT, the deployment of sensor networks is a potentially fruitful path for improving the detection capabilities of dangerous gases. For the purpose of enabling rapid responses to potential risks and promoting informed decision-making, data can be collected and analysed in real time through the utilisation of networked sensors\cite{aldweesh2024mlora}. The success of these sensor networks, on the other hand, is contingent upon the appropriate positioning of sensors over the entire facility. Because of the intricate interaction of a number of factors, including the nature and behaviour of poisonous gases, ambient conditions, the structure of the facility, and the limitations of resources, achieving optimal sensor placement is a daunting problem\cite{khorramifar2023environmental}.

Heuristic methods\cite{pabitha2024chameleon,kaladevi2023breast} or manual decision-making are frequently used in traditional approaches to sensor placement. This might result in setups that are less than ideal and inefficiencies. A unique optimisation strategy, known as the Sailfish Optimizer algorithm\cite{kumar2023sailfish}, is presented in this paper as a solution to the problem that has been created. A new solution to complicated optimisation problems that are characterised by both exploration and exploitation of the search space is provided by this algorithm, which was inspired by the cooperative hunting behaviour of sailfish. The programme search for ideal configurations that strike a balance between the coverage of sensor locations, considerations of cost-effectiveness, and operational restrictions. It does this by replicating the coordinated movement of sailfish, which allows it to effectively navigate across solution spaces\cite{madhavi2023hybrid,rajoriya2023sailfish}.

It is particularly well-suited for resolving the difficulties of sensor placement in IIoT-enabled industrial contexts due to the fact that the Sailfish Optimizer algorithm may be applied to a large range of optimisation problems at the same time. Through the utilisation of the capabilities of the algorithm within the framework of toxic gas detection, the purpose of this article is to improve safety, reduce risks, and maximise the utilisation of resources in factory settings. An in-depth review of the Sailfish Optimizer algorithm and its incorporation into the sensor placement framework will be presented in the following sections. This will be followed by simulation studies and case studies based on the actual world to demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency and practical usefulness.

\section{Literature Review}\label{sec2}
In the realm of industrial safety, the optimal placement of toxic gas detection sensors is a critical concern. Traditional methodologies for sensor placement have been extensively explored, yet they often exhibit limitations in adapting to the dynamic and complex environments typical of industrial settings. This section reviews existing methods for sensor placement in industrial environments, highlighting their shortcomings, and introduces nature-inspired optimization algorithms as potential solutions.

\subsection{Traditional Methods for Sensor Placement}
Researchers investigated the application of deterministic algorithms for sensor placement in industrial environments. Their study revealed that deterministic approaches, while straightforward to implement, often result in suboptimal sensor configurations due to oversights in accounting for environmental factors such as airflow patterns and gas dispersion dynamics. Similarly, studies explored heuristic methods for sensor placement, highlighting their limitations in scalability and adaptability to changing environmental conditions. These traditional methods frequently rely on predefined rules or manual decision-making, which may not adequately capture the complexities of industrial settings, leading to inefficient sensor configurations and increased safety risks\cite{loh2023efficient, naouri2023efficient}.

\subsection{Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithms:}
In response to the limitations of traditional methods, researchers have turned to nature-inspired optimization algorithms as promising alternatives for sensor placement optimization. Genetic algorithm(GA)s, for instance, have been widely studied for their ability to mimic the process of natural selection to evolve optimal solutions\cite{boatwright2023integrated}. In studies, GAs were applied to optimize sensor placements in chemical plants, demonstrating significant improvements in detection accuracy compared to deterministic approaches\cite{shiddiqi2024ga}.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is another nature-inspired algorithm that has shown promise in sensor placement optimization. Researchers used PSO as a population-based optimization technique inspired by the collective behavior of bird flocks\cite{ramasamy2021fuzzy}. PSO has since been applied to various optimization problems, including sensor placement in industrial environments. For example, PSO utilized to optimize sensor placements for gas leak detection in petrochemical plants, achieving superior results in terms of detection coverage and response time\cite{boatwright2023integrated}.

Simulated annealing(SA), inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, is yet another nature-inspired algorithm that has garnered attention for its effectiveness in optimization problems. Stochastic optimization technique capable of escaping local optima by accepting occasional suboptimal solutions. In the context of sensor placement, SA has been applied to optimize sensor locations in hazardous environments, as demonstrated\cite{kumar2024hybrid}. 

In summary, traditional methods for sensor placement in industrial environments exhibit limitations in adapting to dynamic and complex conditions\cite{madhavi2023pythagorean}. Nature-inspired optimization algorithms offer promising avenues for overcoming these limitations by leveraging principles derived from natural phenomena. GAs, PSO, and SA have all demonstrated effectiveness in optimizing sensor placements for toxic gas detection in industrial settings. These algorithms provide robust and adaptable solutions that can enhance safety and mitigate risks in industrial operations.

The research gaps Identified are
\begin{itemize}
\item  Existing methods struggle to adapt to dynamic industrial environments, where factors like airflow patterns and facility layout may change over time.
\item Traditional optimization techniques face scalability issues when applied to large-scale industrial environments with numerous sensors and complex layouts.
\item Traditional optimization techniques face scalability issues when applied to large-scale industrial environments with numerous sensors and complex layouts.
\item While promising in simulations, the real-world applicability and effectiveness of optimization techniques remain uncertain, underscoring the need for validation studies in industrial environments.
\end{itemize}

\section{Proposed Sailfish Optimizer Algorithm for Toxic Gas Detection Sensor Placement in IIoT}\label{sec3}
The proposed Sailfish Optimizer Algorithm for Effective Toxic Gas Detection Sensor Placement in IIoT addresses key challenges in existing methodologies by offering dynamic adaptability to changing industrial environments, scalability to handle large-scale sensor placement problems efficiently, integration of cost considerations to balance detection effectiveness with budget constraints, and validation through real-world deployment to ensure practical applicability and effectiveness.

The Sailfish Optimizer algorithm is based on the cooperative hunting behavior of sailfish. It operates by maintaining a population of individual sailfish agents, each representing a potential solution. The algorithm iteratively updates the positions of these agents to explore the solution space and find optimal configurations. The key steps of the algorithm are outlined in Algorithm~\ref{alg:sailfish}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Sailfish Optimizer Algorithm}
\label{alg:sailfish}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Initialize sailfish population $P$ randomly within the search space
\STATE Initialize parameters: acceleration constants $c_1, c_2$, inertia weight $w$, maximum velocity $v_{\text{max}}$
\WHILE{termination condition not met}
    \FOR{each sailfish $s$ in $P$}
        \STATE Update velocity $v_s$ using Eq.~\eqref{eq:update_velocity}
        \STATE Update position $p_s$ using Eq.~\eqref{eq:update_position}
    \ENDFOR
    \STATE Perform collective behavior update among sailfish
\ENDWHILE
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The velocity and position updates for each sailfish are computed as follows:

\begin{align}
    v_s &= w \cdot v_s + c_1 \cdot \text{rand()} \cdot (p_{\text{best}} - p_s) + c_2 \cdot \text{rand()} \cdot (p_{\text{global}} - p_s) \label{eq:update_velocity} \\
    p_s &= p_s + v_s \label{eq:update_position}
\end{align}

Here, $v_s$ represents the velocity of sailfish $s$, $p_s$ represents the position of sailfish $s$, $p_{\text{best}}$ is the best position found by the sailfish in its personal history, and $p_{\text{global}}$ is the best position found by any sailfish in the population. The parameters $c_1$ and $c_2$ are acceleration constants, $w$ is the inertia weight, and $\text{rand()}$ generates a random number.


\subsection{Methodology}
The methodology outlines the formulation of the sensor placement optimization problem and the integration of the Sailfish Optimizer algorithm with IIoT sensor networks.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Sensor Placement Optimization with Sailfish Optimizer Algorithm}
\label{alg:methodology}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE Sensor placement parameters: Sensor locations $S$, Coverage requirements $C$, Communication range $R$, Budget constraints $B$
\STATE Define objective function $F(S)$ to maximize sensor coverage while minimizing cost
\STATE Define constraints:
    \STATE \quad Sensor coverage constraint: $\sum_{s \in S} \text{coverage}(s) \geq C$
    \STATE \quad Communication range constraint: $\forall s_i, s_j \in S: \text{distance}(s_i, s_j) \leq R$
    \STATE \quad Budget constraint: $\sum_{s \in S} \text{cost}(s) \leq B$
\STATE Formulate optimization problem:
\STATE \quad maximize $F(S)$
\STATE \quad subject to the coverage constraint, communication range constraint, and budget constraint
\STATE Initialize Sailfish Optimizer algorithm with parameters: Population size $N$, Maximum iterations $T$, Acceleration constants $c_1, c_2$, Inertia weight $w$, Maximum velocity $v_{\text{max}}$
\STATE Run Sailfish Optimizer algorithm to find optimal sensor placement $S^*$
\RETURN Optimal sensor placement $S^*$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The methodology formulates the sensor placement optimization problem as a constrained optimization problem, considering factors such as sensor coverage, communication range, and budget constraints. The Sailfish Optimizer algorithm is then integrated into the optimization process to find the optimal sensor placement configuration that maximizes coverage while adhering to the constraints.

The Sailfish Optimizer algorithm is integrated into the IIoT sensor networks by using the algorithm to iteratively optimize the sensor placement configurations. At each iteration, the algorithm dynamically adjusts the sensor positions based on environmental conditions and operational constraints. This integration allows for the seamless deployment of optimized sensor configurations that enhance safety, minimize risks, and optimize resource utilization in industrial environments.

\subsection{Performance Metrics for Toxic Gas Detection Sensor Placement}
In the proposed work on optimal toxic gas detection sensor placement using the Sailfish Optimizer Algorithm in IIoT-enabled industrial environments, several performance metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the optimization approach.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sensor Coverage:}
    The percentage of the industrial area covered by the deployed sensors. It measures the effectiveness of sensor placement in detecting toxic gas releases across the facility.
    \begin{align*}
        SC &= \frac{A_{\text{covered}}}{A_{\text{total}}} \times 100\%
    \end{align*}
    where $A_{\text{covered}}$ is the area covered by sensors and $A_{\text{total}}$ is the total area.
    
    \item \textbf{Detection Accuracy:} The percentage of simulated toxic gas releases detected by the deployed sensors. It assesses the ability of the sensor network to accurately identify hazardous events.
    \begin{align*}
        DA &= \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \times 100\%
    \end{align*}
    where $TP$ is the number of true positive detections and $FN$ is the number of false negatives.
    
    \item \textbf{Response Time:} The time taken by the sensor network to detect and report a toxic gas release. It indicates the efficiency of the detection system in responding to potential threats.
    \begin{align*}
        RT &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} t_i}{N}
    \end{align*}
    where $t_i$ is the response time of the $i$-th detection event and $N$ is the total number of events.
    
    \item \textbf{Convergence Rate:}    
    The convergence rate ($CR$) of an optimization algorithm can be defined as the rate at which the objective function value approaches the optimal solution with respect to the number of iterations ($T$). Mathematically, it can be expressed as:
    \begin{align*}
        CR = \frac{1}{T}
    \end{align*}
    where $T$ is the number of iterations required for the algorithm to converge.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Performance Comparative Results}
Five potential algorithms namely PSO, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)\cite{kurian2024optimizing}, SA, GA and Firefly Algorithm (FA)\cite{annapurna2023multi, demri2023energy}, that are used for comparison with the Sailfish Optimizer Algorithm in the context of toxic gas detection sensor placement. Possible scenarios used for the comparisons are 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Scenario A - Base Scenario:} 
    This scenario represents the baseline case where all algorithms are tested under similar conditions without any specific constraints or variations. It serves as a reference point for comparing the performance of different algorithms.
    
    \item \textbf{Scenario B - Varying Sensor Density:} 
    In this scenario, the density of sensor deployment varies across different regions of the industrial environment. Some areas may have higher concentrations of sensors, while others may have fewer sensors. This scenario tests the ability of algorithms to adapt to varying sensor densities and optimize coverage accordingly.
    
    \item \textbf{Scenario C - Limited Budget:} 
    In this scenario, there is a limited budget available for sensor deployment. Algorithms must optimize sensor placement within the budget constraints while maximizing coverage. This scenario assesses the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of different algorithms in resource-constrained environments.
    
    \item \textbf{Scenario D - Irregular Terrain:} 
    This scenario involves an industrial environment with irregular terrain features such as hills, valleys, or obstacles. Algorithms must optimize sensor placement considering the uneven terrain to ensure effective coverage across the entire area. This scenario tests the robustness and adaptability of algorithms to complex environmental conditions.
    
    \item \textbf{Scenario E - Dynamic Environment:} 
    In this scenario, the industrial environment is dynamic, with changes occurring over time, such as variations in toxic gas release patterns or environmental conditions. Algorithms must continuously adapt and update sensor placement to maintain effective coverage in response to changing conditions. This scenario evaluates the ability of algorithms to handle dynamic environments and respond to real-time events.
\end{enumerate}

The comparative analysis of sensor coverage across various scenarios reveals the superiority of the proposed Sailfish Optimizer algorithm as shown in Table \ref{tab:sensor_coverage_comparison}. In Scenario A, it achieves a coverage of 75\%, outperforming all other algorithms except ACO. Notably, in Scenario B, the Sailfish Optimizer achieves the highest coverage of 78\%, showcasing its adaptability to varying sensor densities.

In environments with irregular terrain (Scenario D), the Sailfish Optimizer achieves the highest coverage of 80\%, emphasizing its effectiveness in optimizing sensor placement. Finally, in dynamic environments (Scenario E), it attains a coverage of 76\%, again outperforming other algorithms. Overall, the Sailfish Optimizer consistently exhibits superior performance in optimizing sensor coverage, making it a promising solution for toxic gas detection sensor placement in IIoT-enabled industrial environments.
